My name is Ram Ekstrom and I am a fourth year PhD candidate at the University of Michigan. My advisor is <a href="https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~smdbackr/">Stephen DeBacker</a> and I like to think about p-adic reductive groups, harmonic analysis, and Bruhat-Tits theory.

I obtained my M.Sc through the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/GraduateStudentHandbook/the-marjorie-lee-browne-scholars-program.html">Marjorie Lee Browne Scholars Program</a> in 2022. Before that I was an undergraduate at the University of Colorado.

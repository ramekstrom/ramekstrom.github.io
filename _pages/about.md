My name is Ram Ekstrom and I am a second year PhD student at the University of Michigan. My advisor is <a href="https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~smdbackr/">Stephen DeBacker</a> and I like to think about p-adic reductive groups and harmonic analysis on them.

I graduated with a M.Sc from the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/GraduateStudentHandbook/the-marjorie-lee-browne-scholars-program.html">Marjorie Lee Browne Scholars Program</a> in 2022. Before that I was an undergraduate at the University of Colorado.

<b>Teaching</b>
I have taught several courses at Michigan as a GSI.

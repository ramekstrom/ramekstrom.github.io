My name is Ram Ekstrom and I am a fourth year PhD candidate at the University of Michigan. My advisor is [Stephen DeBacker](https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~smdbackr/) and I think about $p$-adic reductive groups, harmonic analysis, and Bruhat–Tits theory.


I obtained my M.Sc through the [Marjorie Lee Browne Scholars Program](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/GraduateStudentHandbook/the-marjorie-lee-browne-scholars-program.html) in 2022. Before that I was an undergraduate at the [University of Colorado](https://www.colorado.edu/math/).

### Papers
Hopefully more will go here at some point.

- *Reductive subgroups attached to points in the Bruhat–Tits building*, (forthcoming!)
